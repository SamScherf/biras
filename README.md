# BIRAS
This program will scale up an image and break it into multiple pieces without adding new colors.
This program is still very much in testing and not ready for use yet

## Usage
Simply run:

	biras scale

and enter the requested parameters to scale up and smooth out an image. The file will
then be saved to your current working directory with the name "output.png"

## Plans

- Add cut command to break up image
- Allow scale command to accept folder input
- Allow users to change output name
